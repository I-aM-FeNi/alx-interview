# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Description

This project involves calculating the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a given number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

## Concepts Needed

- **Dynamic Programming**: Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
- **Prime Factorization**: Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.
- **Code Optimization**: Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.
- **Basic Python Programming**: Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should be documented
- Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Usage

To test the function, run the following command:

```bash
./0-main.py
```

## Example

```bash
Min # of operations to reach 4 char: 4
Min # of operations to reach 12 char: 7
```

## Files

- `0-minoperations.py`: Contains the `minOperations` function.
- `0-main.py`: Main file for testing the `minOperations` function.

## Function Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.
    
    Parameters:
    n (int): The target number of H characters.
    
    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of operations needed, or 0 if n is impossible to achieve.
    """
```
